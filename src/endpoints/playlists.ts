   * Get Playlist - https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-playlist
   * Get a playlist owned by a Spotify user.
   * @param playlist_id
   * The Spotify ID of the playlist.
   * Example value: "3cEYpjA9oz9GiPac4AsH4n"
   * @param market
   * An ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code. If a country code is specified, only content that is available in that market will be returned.
   * If a valid user access token is specified in the request header, the country associated with the user account will take priority over this parameter.
   * Note: If neither market or user country are provided, the content is considered unavailable for the client.
   * Users can view the country that is associated with their account in the account settings.
   * Example value: "ES"
   * @param fields
   * Filters for the query: a comma-separated list of the fields to return. If omitted, all fields are returned. For example, to get just the playlist''s description and URI: fields=description,uri. A dot separator can be used to specify non-reoccurring fields, while parentheses can be used to specify reoccurring fields within objects. For example, to get just the added date and user ID of the adder: fields=tracks.items(added_at,added_by.id). Use multiple parentheses to drill down into nested objects, for example: fields=tracks.items(track(name,href,album(name,href))). Fields can be excluded by prefixing them with an exclamation mark, for example: fields=tracks.items(track(name,href,album(!name,href)))
   * Example value: "items(added_by.id,track(name,href,album(name,href)))"
   * @param additional_types
   * A comma-separated list of item types that your client supports besides the default track type. Valid types are: track and episode.
   * Note: This parameter was introduced to allow existing clients to maintain their current behaviour and might be deprecated in the future.
   * In addition to providing this parameter, make sure that your client properly handles cases of new types in the future by checking against the type field of each object.
