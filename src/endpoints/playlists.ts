   * @param playlist_id
   * The Spotify ID of the playlist.
   * Example value: "3cEYpjA9oz9GiPac4AsH4n"
   * @param market
   * An ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code. If a country code is specified, only content that is available in that market will be returned.
   * If a valid user access token is specified in the request header, the country associated with the user account will take priority over this parameter.
   * Note: If neither market or user country are provided, the content is considered unavailable for the client.
   * Users can view the country that is associated with their account in the account settings.
   * Example value: "ES"
   * @param fields
   * Filters for the query: a comma-separated list of the fields to return. If omitted, all fields are returned. For example, to get just the playlist''s description and URI: fields=description,uri. A dot separator can be used to specify non-reoccurring fields, while parentheses can be used to specify reoccurring fields within objects. For example, to get just the added date and user ID of the adder: fields=tracks.items(added_at,added_by.id). Use multiple parentheses to drill down into nested objects, for example: fields=tracks.items(track(name,href,album(name,href))). Fields can be excluded by prefixing them with an exclamation mark, for example: fields=tracks.items(track(name,href,album(!name,href)))
   * Example value: "items(added_by.id,track(name,href,album(name,href)))"
   * @param additional_types
   * A comma-separated list of item types that your client supports besides the default track type. Valid types are: track and episode.
   * Note: This parameter was introduced to allow existing clients to maintain their current behaviour and might be deprecated in the future.
   * In addition to providing this parameter, make sure that your client properly handles cases of new types in the future by checking against the type field of each object.

   * Update Playlist Items - https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/reorder-or-replace-playlists-tracks
   * Either reorder or replace items in a playlist depending on the request's parameters. To reorder items, include range_start, insert_before, range_length and snapshot_id in the request's body. To replace items, include uris as either a query parameter or in the request's body. Replacing items in a playlist will overwrite its existing items. This operation can be used for replacing or clearing items in a playlist.
   * Note: Replace and reorder are mutually exclusive operations which share the same endpoint, but have different parameters. These operations can't be applied together in a single request.
   * @param playlist_id
   * The Spotify ID of the playlist.
   * Example value: "3cEYpjA9oz9GiPac4AsH4n"
   * @param uris
   * A comma-separated list of Spotify URIs to set, can be track or episode URIs. For example: uris=spotify:track:4iV5W9uYEdYUVa79Axb7Rh,spotify:track:1301WleyT98MSxVHPZCA6M,spotify:episode:512ojhOuo1ktJprKbVcKyQ
   * A maximum of 100 items can be set in one request.
   * @param range_start
   * The position of the first item to be reordered.
   * @param insert_before
   * The position where the items should be inserted.
   * To reorder the items to the end of the playlist, simply set insert_before to the position after the last item.
   * Examples:
   * To reorder the first item to the last position in a playlist with 10 items, set range_start to 0, and insert_before to 10.
   * To reorder the last item in a playlist with 10 items to the start of the playlist, set range_start to 9, and insert_before to 0.
   * @param range_length
   * The amount of items to be reordered. Defaults to 1 if not set.
   * The range of items to be reordered begins from the range_start position, and includes the range_length subsequent items.
   * Example:
   * To move the items at index 9-10 to the start of the playlist, range_start is set to 9, and range_length is set to 2.
   * @param snapshot_id
   * The playlist's snapshot ID against which you want to make the changes.
