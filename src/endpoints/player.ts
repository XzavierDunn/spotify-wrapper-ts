   * Get Playback State - https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-information-about-the-users-current-playback
   * Get information about the userâ€™s current playback state, including track or episode, progress, and active device.
   * @param market
   * An ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code. If a country code is specified, only content that is available in that market will be returned.
   * If a valid user access token is specified in the request header, the country associated with the user account will take priority over this parameter.
   * Note: If neither market or user country are provided, the content is considered unavailable for the client.
   * Users can view the country that is associated with their account in the account settings.
   * Example value: "ES"
   * @param additional_types
   * A comma-separated list of item types that your client supports besides the default track type. Valid types are: track and episode.
   * Note: This parameter was introduced to allow existing clients to maintain their current behaviour and might be deprecated in the future.
   * In addition to providing this parameter, make sure that your client properly handles cases of new types in the future by checking against the type field of each object.
